# Scene
Since I got an odd number, I tried making a Star Fox clone for my scene. The player is a capsule that represents the Arwing spacecraft, and they can move around in 4 directions, up, down, left, and right, but they can't move forward. I did this to try and make the movement feel similar to the original game. I also made the player's speed fast as it seems like the ship is also pretty fast in the game. As the game progresses, enemies, which are blue cubes, will periodically spawn in random places on the screen and will damage the player if they touch them. These enemies will disappear about 4 seconds after they spawn so they don't fill the entire screen. The player can also grab a powerup that will restore their ship's health by a small amount.

# Command Pattern
I used a command pattern to make the player take damage from enemies, and to reverse damage when they pick up a powerup. I made a command interface script called "Command" that created the 2 functions my command would have, Execute and Undo. The command script called "DamagePlayer", which inherits from the command interface, gets the player's "ArwingController" in its constructor, and then overrides the Execute and Undo functions. For execute, it calls a function in the "ArwingController" called "DamagePlayer", which records the player's current health in the variable previousHealth, and reduces their health by 10 points if they have more than 0 health. If their health is less than or equal to 0, it's a game over and the scene is reset. For undo, it calls a function called "ReverseDamage", which sets the player's current health to their previous health, the health they had before they were last damaged.

# Object Pool
I used object pooling to spawn enemies into the scene repeatedly every couple of seconds. This way instead of constantly creating and destroying them, it just reuses the objects that have already been created. The enemies have an enemy script that sets their current health to the maximum when they initially spawn, and starts a coroutine the automatically brings the enemy's health down to 0 after a short time and returns them to the pool, which temporarily deactivates the object. This ensures that enemies won't be in the scene for very long. In the "EnemyObjectPool" script, the object pool is set up, which uses a prefab of the enemy game object to be used when instantiating the enemies. It also defines a "Spawn" function that takes a random number of enemies from the pool and spawns each of them in a random location on the screen. The enemies are spawned using the "InvokeRepeating" method, which calls the "Spawn" function every 3 seconds so there will always be new enemies placed in the scene for the player to avoid.

# State Pattern
I used a state pattern to change the speed of the player's ship depending on how much damage they've taken. The "IArwingState" is an interface that sets up the "Handle" function, which defines what each state changes about the player. The "ArwingStateContext" script has a CurrentState public variable for tracking the state the player is currently in and a "Transition" function that switches the current state to the given argument. The player has 3 states: stable, damaged, and wrecked. When the player's health is at 75 or higher, they're in the stable state which sets them to the max speed, which is 12. If their health is at 25 or higher, but less than 75, they're in the damaged state which sets their speed to 8. And if their health is lower than 25, they're in the wrecked state and their speed is set to 4, making them move very slowly.
